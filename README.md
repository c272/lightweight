# Lightweight
*An extremely small portable browser, using as little RAM as possible.*

## Setup
If you wish to edit the source, download the VS2010 solution file from the main repository as a .zip file.
Apart from this, if you just want to use the browser as-is, navigate to the releases branch (found [here](http://github.com/c272/lightweight/releases)) 

## Runtime
The program should automatically run when you click the executable file. As far as I know, the only prerequisites required are .NET 3.0.
